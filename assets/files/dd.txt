Your menstrual cycle
A menstrual cycle begins with the first day of your period, or menstruation [MEN-stroo-AY-shuhn] and starts over again when the next period begins. Throughout a monthly menstrual cycle, your body makes different amounts of chemicals called hormones to prepare for pregnancy. These changing hormone levels can cause menstrual symptoms. Menstrual cycles often change as a woman gets older. A normal cycle lasts between 24 and 38 days.
